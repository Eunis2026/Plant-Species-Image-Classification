***Answer the following questions based on your experience:***
1. How did the number of images per class affect your model’s accuracy?
-Each class contained 250 images, which provided sufficient data for the model to learn distinctive features of each plant species. Since the dataset was balanced, the model achieved more stable and fair predictions across all classes. The higher number of images per class improved overall accuracy and reduced bias during classification.

2. Which plant species were most commonly misclassified and why?
   -fennel,tarragon and bay leaf, since some of the imgs doesn't have a good angle and quality.
   
3. How did changing the epochs, batch size, or learning rate affect the training results?
   -Changing the epochs, batch size, and learning rate clearly affected the model’s performance. Increasing the epochs helped improve accuracy, but too many caused overfitting. Smaller batch sizes made the model learn more carefully, while larger ones made training faster. The learning rate also mattered—too high made the training unstable, and too low made it slow. Finding the right balance helped improve the overall accuracy.
   
4. What challenges did you encounter during dataset collection and labeling?
   - the Hardest part is to collect imgs from internet with no duplicates.
5. If you were to improve your model, what specific changes would you make and why?
-the imgs with the watermarks.
